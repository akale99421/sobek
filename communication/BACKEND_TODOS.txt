When you complete a task that frontend needs:
1. Update FRONTEND_TODOS.txt with the new capability
2. Document the API in BACKEND_CHANGELOG.txt
3. Include example request/response

Current frontend blockers:
- Waiting for file upload endpoint to connect "Analyze Files" button
- Needs file list endpoint to display uploaded files
